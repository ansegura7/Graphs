# Web Scraping - Covid19 Data
Web scraping is the (generally automatic) process of collecting semi-structured data from the web, filtering and storing it, and then using it in another process.

## Motivation
Create a web scraper bot to obtain data on confirmed cases and deaths of Covid-19, in order to analyze them.

## Run Bot
To run the web scraper bot on Windows, type the following commands (below) at the **Command Prompt** or just run the batch file **run-win.bat** (which is in the /run folder).

``` console
  cd "..\code"
  conda activate base
  python web_scraper.py
```

**Important**: previously, add Anaconda Python paths to Environment Variables -> User Variables.
``` console
  where python
```

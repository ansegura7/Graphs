# Web Scraping - Covid19 Data
Web scraping is the (generally automatic) process of collecting semi-structured data from the web, filtering and storing it, and then using it in another process.

## Motivation
Create a web scraper bot to obtain data on confirmed cases and deaths of Covid-19, in order to analyze them.

## Run Bot
There are several ways to run the web scraper bot on Windows:

1. Type the following commands (below) at the **Anaconda Prompt**.

``` console
  cd "WebScraping_Covid19\code\"
  python web_scraper.py
```

2. Type the following commands (below) at the **Windows Command Prompt**. Previously, Anaconda Python paths must be added to: Environment Variables -> User Variables.

``` console
  cd "WebScraping_Covid19\code\"
  conda activate base
  python web_scraper.py
```

3. Directly run the batch file **run-win.bat** (found in the run/ folder).

In order to automate the process, a Task can be created in the **Windows Task Scheduler**, to configure the execution of the web scraper bot every x hours.

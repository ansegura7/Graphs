# Web Scraping - Covid19 Data
Web scraping is the (generally automatic) process of collecting semi-structured data from the web, filtering and storing it, and then using it in another process.

## Motivation
Create a web scraper bot to obtain data on confirmed cases and deaths of Covid-19, in order to analyze them.

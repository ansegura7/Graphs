# Web Scraping - Covid19 Data
Web scraping is the (generally automatic) process of collecting semi-structured data from the web, filtering and storing it, and then using it in another process.

## Motivation
Create a web scraper bot to obtain data on confirmed cases and deaths of Covid-19, in order to analyze them.

## Data
The data obtained through web scraping are:

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| country | Country name |
| total_cases | Total number of cases |
| total_deaths | Total number of deaths |
| total_recovered | Total number of people recovered |
| active_cases | Number of active cases |
| serious_critical | Number of critical cases |
| tot_cases_1m_pop | Number of cases per one million population |
| deaths_1m_pop | Number of deaths per one million population |
| total_tests | Total number of tests |
| tests_1m_pop | Number of tests per one million population |
| datestamp | Data timestamp |

The latest data reported by country can be seen at the following <a href="https://github.com/ansegura7/WebScraping_Covid19/blob/master/data/current_data.csv" target="_blank" >link</a>.

And <a href="https://github.com/ansegura7/WebScraping_Covid19/blob/master/sql/DDL%20-%20Create%20Main%20Table.sql" target="_blank" >here</a>, you can find the definition of the table where the scraped data is stored.

## Dependencies
The project was carried out with the latest version of <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/" target="_blank" >Anaconda</a> on Windows.

If the main Web Scraping libraries do not come with the selected Anaconda distribution, you can install them with the following commands:
``` console
  conda install -c anaconda beautifulsoup4
  conda install -c conda-forge selenium
```

The specific Python 3.7 libraries used are:

``` python
  # Import util libraries
  import logging
  import yaml
  import csv
  from datetime import datetime
  
  # Database libraries
  import pyodbc

  # Import Web Scraping 1 libraries
  from urllib.request import urlopen
  from urllib.request import Request
  from urllib.error import HTTPError
  from urllib.error import URLError
  from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
  
  # Import Web Scraping 2 libraries
  from selenium import webdriver
  from selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options
```

## Run Bot
There are several ways to run this web scraper bot on Windows:

1. Type the following commands (below) at the **Anaconda Prompt**.

``` console
  cd "WebScraping_Covid19\code\"
  python web_scraper.py
```

2. Type the following commands (below) at the **Windows Command Prompt**. Previously, Anaconda Python paths must be added to: Environment Variables -> User Variables.

``` console
  cd "WebScraping_Covid19\code\"
  conda activate base
  python web_scraper.py
```

3. Directly run the batch file **run-win.bat** (found in the run/ folder).

### Automate Execution
In order to automate the process, a Task can be created in the **Windows Task Scheduler**, to configure the execution of the web scraper bot every x hours.

1. Create a new **Task** in Windows Task Scheduler.

![task-sch-1-img](https://github.com/ansegura7/WebScraping_Covid19/blob/master/img/task-sch-1.PNG?raw=true)

2. Set up a **Trigger** that runs the task every day every x hours.

![task-sch-2-img](https://github.com/ansegura7/WebScraping_Covid19/blob/master/img/task-sch-2.PNG?raw=true)

3. In the **Action** tab, select the .bat file and the folder from where the Task will be executed.
